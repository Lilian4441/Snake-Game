# SnakeGame
<h3> A graphical user interface application that simulates a fully playable Snake game. </h3>
<h5> Completed: June 2023 </h5>

This personal project involved creating and using objects and new classes to develop an interactive graphical application. I gained additional experience with the Java AWT API to develop components vital to the playability of the game. I was also able to practice with Javaâ€™s Action Listener class for defining how the program responds to key-based input.
